## <center> Mini Project 2: Computational Art Reflection </center>
###### <center> Sam Coleman </center>

From a process point of view, I think asking for help from NINJAs when I was confused went well. After completing steps 0 and 1, I was confused by what the instructions were saying for Step 2. After reading it multiple times, and being just as confused, I went to NINJA hours. This helped a lot and I understood the project at a conceptual level, which allowed me to start to actually code it successfully. Going forward, I want to look at more coding problems in a recursive way.

I think that a mix of the original creators of this assignment, Amon and Steve, and I all deserve credit for the creation of the final piece of computational art. If I were to code this myself with no scaffolding or ideas, then I would deserve all the credit. However, I was able to code this because of the scaffolding provided by various people. The credit should not, however, go to the computer. The computer just computed the code I created and spit out the image.
